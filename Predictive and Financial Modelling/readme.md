# Predicting Stock Prices using ARIMA and Neural Network
In this project I built a time series model based on quarterly results of the healthcare industry. 
Different variables like assests, marketcap, P/E ratio. 20 Quarterly results have been analyzed and portfolio has been 
created with five buckets. 
A model with neural nets has resulted in better predictions.
