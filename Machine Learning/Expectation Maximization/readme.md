# Implementing Expectation Maximization Algorithm
*The project is about implementing Expectation Maximization Algorithm manually in R on a given dataset. 
*The goal was to complete an expectation maximization model from the beginning which consisted of initializing 
the problem through K-means and then running the expectation maximization model for each K value.
*The dataset consisted of 71 variables, inclusive of ID and 70 vectors, and 1077 observations.
