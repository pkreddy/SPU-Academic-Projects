# Predicting Breast Cancer using different Algorithms
* In this project we used lda algorithm from the MASS package, the knn algorithm from the class package, 
the glm function for logistic regression, and the svm function from the e1071 package in R to classify malignant vs. benign breast tumors. 
* The dataset can be found at the UCI Machine Learning Repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html, 
and is labeled Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic). 
* The dataset contains the ID, diagnosis, and 30 real-valued input features.
